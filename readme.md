# Zomato SQL Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides an advanced analysis of customer behavior on Zomato using SQL. The focus is on understanding spending patterns, customer engagement, and loyalty program performance, specifically within the Zomato Gold membership context. The insights generated can help improve marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and optimize the Zomato Gold program.

## Objectives
- **Customer Spending Analysis**: Evaluate the total amount spent by each customer to identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Customer Engagement**: Measure how many unique days each customer has visited Zomato, providing insights into user engagement and frequency of purchases.
- **First Purchase Analysis**: Determine the first product purchased by each customer to better understand initial user preferences and inform promotional strategies for new users.
- **Most Purchased Items**: Identify the most popular items on the menu to optimize inventory and marketing efforts based on customer preferences.
- **Points Accumulation**: Analyze how customers accumulate Zomato points based on their purchases and determine which products contribute most to their loyalty points.
- **Membership Impact Analysis**: Assess the spending and points earned by customers in their first year after joining the Zomato Gold program, comparing the performance of different users.
- **Transaction Ranking**: Rank transactions for each Zomato Gold member to track their activity and identify patterns over time, while marking transactions for non-Gold members as 'NA'.

## Advanced Methods Used
- **Window Functions**: Employed to rank transactions and calculate cumulative values without collapsing the dataset. This allows for detailed insights into customer purchasing behavior over time.
- **Subqueries**: Utilized to encapsulate complex queries and derive intermediary results, such as determining the first purchased product and the most popular items on the menu.
- **Date Handling**: Implemented to filter transactions based on specific time frames, such as determining purchases made during the first year of Gold membership and analyzing purchase behavior before joining the program.
- **Aggregation Functions**: Used to summarize data, such as counting distinct days of visits and summing total amounts spent, which helps in understanding customer engagement levels.

## Impact
The insights derived from this analysis can significantly influence Zomato's marketing strategies and customer engagement initiatives. By understanding customer behavior and preferences, Zomato can:
- **Enhance Customer Retention**: Tailor loyalty programs and promotions to high-value customers based on their spending patterns.
- **Optimize Product Offerings**: Focus on promoting the most purchased items to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Improve User Experience**: Use engagement metrics to create personalized experiences for users, potentially increasing the frequency of visits.
- **Strategize Membership Programs**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the Gold program and refine its structure to maximize customer loyalty and retention.

## Conclusion
The analyses conducted in this project provide a comprehensive understanding of Zomato's customer dynamics, especially regarding their Gold membership program. Leveraging these insights can help Zomato strengthen its market position and enhance customer loyalty.
